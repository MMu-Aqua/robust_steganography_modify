Generated message: the development of artificial intelligence, and it has led to more problems than solutions in terms that are related directly or through an interaction with other people. And so what does AI do? It's trying its best at finding new things for us that might be useful as well as we want them, but also making decisions based on our understanding of how these systems work."

Generated message: the development of more sophisticated AI-related technologies, such as artificial neural net systems (AI) or machine learning. These new approaches are often used to solve a number and variety problems in science, engineering research for example – but these methods have also become popular because they can help with many other areas that require specialized expertise, including education about human intelligence (such Asimov's 1984 novel Artificial Intelligence).
The main difference between this type approach to solving scientific challenges is not so much its complexity nor what makes
