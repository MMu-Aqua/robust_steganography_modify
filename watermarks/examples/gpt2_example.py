"""
Example of watermarking with GPT-2.

Note: GPT-2 uses Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization, which means tokens
can be subwords or multiple words. Due to BPE merge rules, the same text can sometimes
be tokenized differently during encoding vs decoding. These tokenization mismatches
act similar to a small attack on the watermark, as they can disrupt the n-gram patterns
used for watermarking. This makes the watermarking less reliable but allows for more
natural language generation.
