# Critical Measurements for Steganography System

## 1. Security Against Detection (Primary Security Goal)
- ROC curves for steganalysis resistance
- Purpose: Prove messages cannot be detected by adversary
- Compare: Random vs informed adversary detection rates
- Include: Statistical significance, confidence intervals

## 2. Message Recovery Success (Primary Functionality)
- Basic recovery rate of embedded messages
- Purpose: Prove system works reliably
- Measure: % of bits correctly recovered
- Test with: Various message sizes, multiple messages
- Include: Error rates, confidence scores

## 3. Attack Resistance Table
- Recovery rates under common attacks:
  * Statistical attacks
  * Transformation attacks
  * Noise injection
  * Combined attacks
- Purpose: Prove practical robustness
- Compare: Performance degradation vs attack strength
- Include: Both modes' performance

## 4. Capacity Analysis
- Maximum reliable payload size
- Purpose: Show practical limits and usability
- Measure: Bits/sample while maintaining security
- Include: Trade-off with detection resistance

## 5. Efficiency Metrics
- Embedding/extraction time
- Purpose: Demonstrate practical usability
- Measure: Time vs message size
- Include: Memory usage, scaling behavior

## Experimental Setup Requirements
- Large enough sample size for statistical significance
- Multiple random seeds/trials
- Clear baseline comparisons
- Error bars/confidence intervals
- Both modes tested under identical conditions

## Presentation Format
- Clear tables for attack resistance
- ROC curves for detection resistance
- Graphs showing capacity/security trade-offs
- Statistical significance for all key results

Priority: Focus on security metrics first (1-3), then practical metrics (4-5)
