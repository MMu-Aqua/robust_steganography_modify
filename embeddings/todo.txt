train new pca model on better distribution

test and iterate on one way monologue system prompt

write measurement code. it should be a folder to hold graphs and tables and the code to generate them

add type hints

deal with temp_pca directory

add documentation to all code

add license

add requirements.txt

check for weird corruptions in padding head in error correction that could cause an exception to occur (like accessing past the end of the list). what is the worst case for convolutional codes?

steg.py resume and sample (non concurrent) are out of date. Maybe delete?

write testing code
- hash functions
- steganography

need to test
- example.py
    - various combinations of real inputs
- example_simulation.py
    - convolutional code
    - hash block sizes that are not 1
    - ascii
- rerun unit test
    - add testing all encodings

currently users need to agree on block size ahead of time. can we make this dynamic? i think it needs to be the current way

Add config file of starting histories
test corporate pca hash accuracy
