    "After consulting with the development team, we've identified several key milestones that need to be addressed before proceeding. The current testing phase has revealed some potential integration issues with our legacy systems, particularly in the trade validation module. We're working on implementing the necessary fixes and expect to have an updated timeline by end of week.",
    
    "Given the complexity of these changes, I believe it would be beneficial to schedule a stakeholder review meeting. We should include representatives from Risk Management, IT Operations, and the Trading desk to ensure all requirements are being met. I've asked Sarah to coordinate calendars for next Tuesday afternoon."
